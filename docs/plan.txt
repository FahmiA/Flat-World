Planned:
	* As a user, I want to see my level progress in a HUD so I can understand how well I have done.
		- Implement HUD display
			- Ensure ContentManager is updated to manage fonts as well as sprites.
		- Syncronise HUD with game state

	* As a user, I want to be able to catch sheep.
		- Player can catch sheep
		- Sheep capture updates HUD.
		- Dog chases player

	* As a user, I want sheepdogs to attack me so the game is more challenging and promotes more strategy.
		- Sheepdogs can attack player.
			- Result: Player gets pushed/thrown backwards

	* As a user, I want to collect stars to ensure I am constantly rewarded for navigating a level.
		- Spawn stars into levels
		- Allow player to capture star on touch.
		- Update HUD on star capture
